These techniques accurately represent the attack vectors observed in the scenario."

    "content": "Certainly! To perform a pentest scan on `lms.hust.edu.vn`, we'll focus on identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, such as those related to phishing (T1566) and PowerShell execution (T1059.001). Here\u2019s what the scan might include:\n\n1. **Phishing Vulnerabilities**: Check for weak authentication mechanisms or outdated systems that could be targeted with phishing attacks.\n2. **PowerShell Execution**: Look for misconfigurations in IIS or other web servers that allow PowerShell scripts to run, which could be exploited by attackers.\n\n### Steps for the Scan:\n1. **Website Content Analysis**:\n   - Review the website\u2019s content and structure for any suspicious links or forms that might be used in phishing attempts.\n   \n2. **Server Configuration Check**:\n   - Ensure that no unnecessary services are running on the server.\n   - Verify that file execution policies, such as those related to PowerShell, are properly configured.\n\n3. **Vulnerability Scanning**:\n   - Use tools like Nmap or OpenVAS to scan for known vulnerabilities in the web application and underlying infrastructure.\n   \n4. **Phishing Simulation Test**:\n   - Conduct a simulated phishing test using emails that mimic legitimate HR notifications to see if employees might fall for such scams.\n\n5. **Security Headers Check**:\n   - Ensure that security headers like X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security are properly set up to mitigate risks.\n\n### Recommendations to Prevent Phishing Attacks:\n1. **Employee Training**: Regularly train employees on recognizing phishing attempts.\n2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA wherever possible to add an extra layer of security.\n3. **Email Filtering**: Use email filtering solutions that can detect and block suspicious emails.\n4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all systems, software, and applications up-to-date with the latest patches.\n\nWould you like to proceed with a detailed scan or need assistance setting up any of these measures?"
